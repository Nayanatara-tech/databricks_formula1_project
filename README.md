**📌 Project Overview:**

This project is a Formula One–themed data engineering practice where I implemented a full medallion architecture using Bronze (raw), Silver (clean/processed), and Gold (presentation) layers. The goal was to simulate an end‑to‑end ETL workflow—from data ingestion to transformation to analytics-ready outputs.
To support this pipeline, I provisioned and connected various Azure resources, including:

Azure Databricks workspace for notebooks, workflows, and Delta Lake processing
Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) for raw, processed, and curated data layers
Azure Key Vault for securely storing secrets
Azure Data Factory for orchestrating pipeline activities
Unity Catalog for practicing modern data governance—setting up external locations, assigning permissions, and creating both managed and external tables
